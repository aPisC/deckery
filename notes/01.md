# Microservice architecture

## Web ui 
React application for user game and deck management

## Web api
Backend service for Web ui communicating on REST

## Game ui
React app for game page

## Game api
Socket endpoint for game client connections
Sending messages for gameManager through MessageQueue
Sending messages to users from dedicated response MessageQueue

## Game Manager
Game manager assigns a gameServer to a specifig game.
Maps messages to GameServers based on game identifiers.
Maps responses from game servers to GameApi pods.
Keeps track of the available Game servers, automatically assigns and reassings game servers for running games.
Keeps track of player availability where the responses sent to.
Handles gameServer swapping registering and disconnecting.

## GameServer
Handles game state calculations, stores the needed informations in local caches. The handling of action in gameServer is asyncronous. Because the games explicitly mapped to one server, and the messages are queued, the transactions will be atomic per game.
